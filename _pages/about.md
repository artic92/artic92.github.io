With a profound expertise in **aerospace**, **aviation**, and **satellite applications**, my engineering journey is fueled by a passion for leveraging technology to navigate the challenges of space and aviation safety. My technical foundation is solidified by extensive experience with C, Python, Linux, VHDL, and real-time operating systems, driving innovations that enhance the reliability and safety of critical systems.

Graduating with a Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering from [Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II](http://www.unina.it/en_GB/home), my career has spanned impactful projects such as flight control software for the [Eurofighter Typhoon](https://www.eurofighter.com/the-aircraft), digital design for the [ESA PLATO](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Plato#:~:text=The%20mission,exomoons%20and%20rings%20around%20them.) mission, and the [Nyx](https://www.exploration.space/nyx) spacecraft. These experiences not only honed my technical skills but also underscored the importance of leadership, teamwork, and a proactive approach to problem-solving.

What drives me is a relentless curiosity about the universe and a commitment to making it safer and more accessible through technology. I'm particularly proud of my contributions to the field, including publications on **IoT security** and presenting at industry conferences, which reflect my dedication to **continuous learning** and **professional growth**.

As I look to the future, I'm excited about connecting with fellow professionals and organizations passionate about aerospace and embedded systems. Whether it's collaborating on innovative projects, sharing insights at conferences, or mentoring the next generation of engineers, I'm eager to contribute to our collective journey toward technological excellence.

Let's explore the endless possibilities of aerospace innovation together. If you're interested in collaborating, exchanging knowledge, or discussing potential opportunities, I'd love to hear from you.
